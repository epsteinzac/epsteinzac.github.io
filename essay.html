                New York City, for me, started one block away from where I live today within Kips Bay in the NYU (New York University) hospital. I have grown to love the excitement and intricacies of my neighborhood ever since. The best way to describe it is that there's always something interesting going on, always some excitement. I recall my mother always using the phrase "only in New York!" as we saw crazy people in the neighborhood. One such instance was when this man, many years ago, would put a pink, sparkly, dress on and a bike around the nearby school every morning. It was certainly a sight to behold, a seemingly normal occurrence in New York City. I wonder what happened to that guy. Walking down 28th street my mother would always say "only in New York!" as we kept to ourselves, scurrying past the entrance to a homeless shelter where there would often be strange figures present.

                As a young child, I would spend countless hours every day playing outside in the park/garden with the other kids from my building. Our nannies or grandparents would drop us off and sit on the benches and watch us play. The kids in the park and I would ride around on our scooters and bikes. We would marvel at the trees in the garden and let our imaginations run wild. I remember one such tree, an Evergreen, which was the perfect size for our fort where we would hold meetings and discuss the activities of the day and play games. Entrance into these meetings was very exclusive and it was our own "little club" in which adults would not be allowed. The tree fort went on for a while until one day we found a dead bird in there and no one ever wanted to go back. After a while we grew older and had other responsibilities, so we stopped playing together. I still see the kids that I once played with walking down the street, but we don't acknowledge each other. I guess that it's almost scary to look back at your childhood friends because that means you accept the fact that you are growing up.

                There's a movie theater on the west side of my block, a special place for me. Etched into the side of the movie theater's building from the outside are scenes from some of the most classic movies of all time, Indiana Jones, The Wizard of Oz, and Titanic just to name a few. Once entering the movie theater you are greeted with a grand hall and a beautiful mural, which wraps around the perimeter of the room, featuring scenes from some of the greatest movies of all time. I truly think that this movie theater is the greatest and most beautiful one I've personally ever been in. I have so many memories of my family/friends and me in the movie theater as a kid.

                I feel the most comfortable in New York City in my neighborhood; it's where I feel safe. I wouldn't have wanted it any other way, growing up where I did. There's no doubt that my unique experience of New York City fostered me into the person I am today and gave me an individual and personal perspective on the city.
